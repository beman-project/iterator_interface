## How to Build

### Dependencies

This project is mainly tested on `Ubuntu 22.04` and `Ubuntu 24.04`, but it should be as portable as CMake is. This project has zero C or C++ dependencies.

It does require few tools as build-time dependencies:

- `cmake`
- `ninja`, `make`, or another CMake-supported build system
  - CMake defaults to "Unix Makefiles" on POSIX systems

Example of installation on `Ubuntu 24.04`:
```shell
# install tools
apt-get install -y cmake make ninja-build

# example of toolchains
apt-get install g++-14 gcc-14 clang-18 clang++-18
```

### Instructions

Full set of supported toolchains can be found in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](#.github/workflows/ci.yml).

#### Basic Build

This project strives to be as normal and simple a CMake project as possible. This build workflow in particular will work, producing a static `beman_optional26` library, ready to package:

```shell
cmake --workflow --preset gcc-14
```

This should build and run the tests with GCC 14 with the address and undefined behavior sanitizers enabled.

#### More complex cases

The CMake preset system suffers from combinitorial explosion. There is a makefile in the root of the repository to aid in running more configurations.

```shell
make -k TOOLCHAIN=clang-18  CONFIG=Tsan  VERBOSE=1
```

The makefile will use your system compiler, `c++`, if no toolchain name is provided, otherwise it will use the toolchain in the etc/ directory to perform the build. The Ninja multi config generator is used, with configurations for `RelWithDebugInfo`, `Debug`, `Tsan`, and `Asan` configured by default.
